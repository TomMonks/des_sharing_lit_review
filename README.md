## Aim and research questions:

The overarching research aim is determine to what extent authors of DES health studies share models and where models are shared how is this done.

### Primary research questions

1. What proportion of DES healthcare studies share code? 
2. How is sharing affected by FOSS, Covid-19, publication type and year of publication?
3. What proportion of studies make use of a reporting guideline?
4. What methods, tools, and resources did authors use to share their computer models and code?
5. To what extent do the DES health community follow best practice for open science when sharing computer models?
6. To what extent can the healthcare DES community improve its sharing of computer models?

## Dependencies

[![Python 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

All dependencies can be found in [`binder/environment.yml`]() and are pulled from conda-forge.  To run the code locally, we recommend install [mini-conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html); navigating your terminal (or cmd prompt) to the directory containing the repo and issuing the following command:

> `conda env create -f binder/environment.yml`

**Online Alternatives**:

* Visit our [jupyter book]((https://tommonks.github.io/des_sharing_lit_review) for interactive code and explanatory text
* Run out Jupyter notebooks in binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://github.com/TomMonks/des_sharing_lit_review/main)

## Study data

All study data is contained within this repository.  It can be found in the `data` sub-directory.

**Main data files:**

* `share_sim_data_extract.zip`: main study data stored as a CSV. It includes all publications carried forward to the data extraction phase.
* `bp_audit.zip`: Contains the studies and additional data extraction used within the best practice audit of shared computer models.

## Testing 

If any updates to the data are made we recommend re-running the [Data source testing notebook](https://github.com/TomMonks/des_sharing_lit_review/blob/main/content/03_results/12_data_testing_bkp.ipynb).  This will perform a set of tests on the main and best practice audit datasets to check that data is in the correct place and format.
