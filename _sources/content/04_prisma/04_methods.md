# Methods

## 5. Eligibility Criteria

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified within the methods chapter in [Inclusion](../02_methods/02_inclusion) and [Data Extraction](../02_methods/03_extraction) sections.
`````

## 6. Information sources

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
The databases used in the study were ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Pubmed Central.  The dates of the last search for each database was the 09/03/2023.  Details are listed in the [Search Strategy](../02_methods/01_search_strategy) section.
`````

## 7. Search strategy

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We have provided full search strings for each [database](../02_methods/01_search_strategy)
`````

## 8. Selection process

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We have provided full details on the process our two reviewers used to select each study in the section on [Study selection](../02_methods/02_inclusion)
`````

## 9. Data collection process

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We have provided full details of the data extraction and audit process that we employed in the research. See [Data Extraction](../02_methods/03_extraction)
`````

## 10. Data items

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We split our review into two parts: data extraction from all papers included, and a more detailed best practice audit of those studies that did share their models and code that would allow us to critically appraise practice.  
`````

### 10a. Primary outcomes

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We list all information extracted in first part of our review in the [Data Extraction](../02_methods/03_extraction) section.  For our subset analysis, we provide a detailed discussion and presentation of our criteria in [Best Practice Audit](../02_methods/04_quality_audit) section.
`````

### 10b. Other variables

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We collected additional variables in the first part of our review and these are also listed within [Data Extraction](../02_methods/03_extraction).  Our focus here was on the platform for sharing and if the studies used a reporting guideline.
`````

## 11. Study risk of bias assessment

`````{admonition} NOT APPLICABLE
:class: caution
Bias of this type is not applicable to the type of study conducted.  A limitation of the study is that we cannot comment on the practice of models shared that are not referenced in the study article.
`````

## 12. Effect measures

`````{admonition} NOT APPLICABLE
:class: caution
This study does not estimate an effect.
`````

## 13 Synthesis methods

### 13a Process to determine eligibility for synthesis

`````{admonition} COMPLETE
:class: seealso
We categorised the best practice audit into models developing using code based tools (such as python and R) and commericial off the shelf simulation packages (such as ARENA and Simul8). [Best Practice Audit Dataset](../02_methods/04_quality_audit)

During data extraction we categorised the data into FOSS and commerical simulation packages.  As well as Covid-19 and non-covid-19. [Main dataset](../03_results/01_preprocessing) 

`````

### 13b Data preparation

`````{admonition} COMPLETE
:class: seealso
We have provided the code and detail on the process to pre-process the datasets before analysis. [Main dataset](../03_results/01_preprocessing) and [Best Practice Audit](../03_results/04_bpa_preprocessing)
`````

### 13c Methods for tabulation and visualisation

`````{admonition} COMPLETE
:class: seealso
We have provided jupyter notebooks containing the code that produces the tables and figures. See section on results. 
`````

### 13d Methods used to synthesise results

`````{admonition} COMPLETE
:class: seealso
All software used to synthesise results are described in detail [here](../02_methods/05_analysis_env)
`````

### 13e Methods to explore heterogeneity

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We split our analysis by publication type i.e. journal articles, full paper conference proceedings, and book chapters.  See [article type](../03_results/03_article_type) section.
`````

### 13f Sensitivity analyses

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
The main result of number of models shared is broken down by year.  See [article type](../03_results/03a_year) section.
`````

## 14. Reporting bias assessment

`````{admonition} NOT APPLICABLE
:class: caution
This study does not estimate an effect.
`````
## 15. Certainty assessment

`````{admonition} NOT APPLICABLE
:class: caution
This study does not estimate an effect.
