`````

## 7. Search strategy

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We have provided full search strings for each [database](../02_methods/01_search_strategy)
`````

## 8. Selection process

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We have provided full details on the process our two reviewers used to select each study in the section on [Study selection](../02_methods/02_inclusion)
`````

## 9. Data collection process

`````{admonition} INCOMPLETE
:class: warning
**To do: ** A random sample to re-review/cross-review.
`````

## 10. Data items

We split our review into two parts: data extraction from all papers included, and a more detailed best practice audit of those studies that did share their models and code that would allow us to critically appraise practice.  

### 10a. Primary outcomes

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We list all information extracted in first part of our review in the [Data Extraction](../02_methods/03_extraction) section.  For our subset analysis, we provide a detailed discussion and presentation of our criteria in [Best Practice Audit](../02_methods/04_quality_audit) section.
`````

### 10b. Other variables

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We collected additional variables in the first part of our review and these are also listed within [Data Extraction](../02_methods/03_extraction).  Our focus here was on the platform for sharing and if the studies used a reporting guideline.
`````

## 11. Study risk of bias assessment

`````{admonition} NOT APPLICABLE
:class: error
Bias of this type is not applicable to the type of study conducted.  A limitation of the study is that we cannot comment on the practice of models shared that are not referenced in the study article.
`````

## 12. Effect measures

`````{admonition} NOT APPLICABLE
:class: error
This study does not estimate an effect.

### 13b Data preparation

`````{admonition} COMPLETE
:class: seealso
We have provided the code and detail on the process to pre-process the datasets before analysis. [Main dataset](../03_results/01_preprocessing) and [Best Practice Audit](../03_results/04_bpa_preprocessing)

### 13e Methods to explore heterogeneity

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
We split our analysis by publication type i.e. journal articles, full paper conference proceedings, and book chapters.  See [article type](../03_results/03_article_type) section.
`````

### 13f Sensitivity analyses

`````{admonition} COMPLETED
:class: seealso
The main result of number of models shared is broken down by year.  See [article type](../03_results/03a_year) section.
